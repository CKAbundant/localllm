Horton","In today's segment of Good Buy or Goodbye, host Julie Hyman is joined by Tolou Capital Management founder and chief investment officer Spencer Hakimian to evaluate his top investment pick and which stock to steer clear of. Hakimian recommends JPMorgan (JPM) as a buy, citing three key factors. First, he anticipates the new Trump administration will implement lighter banking regulations, potentially boosting the company's profitability. Second, he points to proposed tax cuts, explaining, ""At the end of the day, a tax cut will one way or another lead to extra deposits that will flow to all banks,"" with JPMorgan positioned to capture a significant portion as the industry's largest bank. Finally, Hakimian views the persistent high interest rate environment as highly favorable for banking operations, allowing institutions to earn ""a very nice interest"" in their lending activities. Conversely, Hakimian cautions investors against buying homebuilding company D.R. Horton (DHI) stock. He identifies a concerning oversupply in Sun Belt markets that emerged ""in the aftermath of COVID"" as people left northeastern states in favor of states like Florida and Texas, to which builders responded with ""excess inventory."" This inventory surplus can force price reductions that compress profit margins. Additionally, Hakimian warns that evolving political policies on tariffs and immigration might impact housing prices and demand. Lastly, he emphasizes that elevated interest rates continue to suppress new home purchases, with consumers increasingly favoring existing properties over new construction.

The Colonial Pipeline, a key 5,500-mile (8,851 km) artery for shipping fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the East Coast, this month sought approval from FERC to stop shipping different grades of gasoline at the same time and to reduce the total number of grades it moves on the pipeline.

Oil’s inherent volatility leads many investors to overreact—piling into energy stocks when prices spike and fleeing at the first sign of a drop. This short-term mindset seldom pays off because oil is influenced by countless factors, from geopolitics to production decisions and economic cycles. Despite headlines about renewables, fossil fuels remain essential for AI data centers, global manufacturing, and massive infrastructure projects. US producers also provide a stabilizing force by ramping up supply whenever prices run too high, making this a far cry from the days when OPEC alone set the tone. The takeaway? Quit treating oil (CL=F, BZ=F) like a lottery ticket. Instead, focus on companies poised to thrive through all market phases—refiners, pipeline operators, and diversified firms. By recognizing oil’s continued importance and the industry’s structural shifts, you’ll be better positioned for long-term gains over short-lived swings. Watch more episodes of Trader Talk here.

2025-03-01 22:50:00,NFLX,Yahoo Finance Video,last month,"NFL Netflix games, Nike & Kim Kardashian collab: Sports Report","It has been a jam-packed week in the world of sports business news. Netflix (NFLX) has expressed interest in taking the NFL rights to Sunday afternoon games, Nike (NKE) has partnered with Kim Kardashian’s Skims, ESPN has ended its broadcasting deal with the MLB, and so much more. This week on Yahoo Finance Sports Report, host Joe Pompliano takes a look at some of this week’s biggest headlines in the sports business world that you and your portfolio need to know. US infrastructure not ready for 2026 World Cup, 2028 Olympics Last week, the US Travel Association, a nonprofit organization that represents the travel industry - released a report saying the US air travel system is not properly equipped to handle the impending surge in travel tourism coming to the country in the next few years. Between the 2026 FIFA World Cup, 2028 Summer Olympics, and even America’s 250th birthday in 2026, an estimated 40 million people may visit the United States. If the White House does not get involved and implement reforms to improve infrastructure and technology, the country could face threats to national security, lose millions of visitors, and thus millions of dollars in visitor spending. Netflix expresses interest in taking Sunday afternoon NFL games from CBS and Fox Following Netflix’s successful streaming of the 2024 NFL Christmas Day games, which drew in 26.5 million average viewers, the streamer is looking to add more NFL to their roster. Netflix is reportedly looking to acquire one of the NFL’s Sunday afternoon games from CBS or Fox (FOX) if the media rights go back on the market. The NFL’s current media rights deal runs through 2033, but the NFL can choose to opt out of them in 2029. While breaking this down, Pompliano also expresses his concerns about CBS’s current media rights deal due to the network’s parent company Paramount’s (PARA) impending merger with Skydance. Nike and Skims partnership fuels $6.7 billion in market value to the athleticwear brand. Nike announced it is partnering with Kim Kardashian’s shapewear line Skims to release a new line of women’s athleticwear to be released this spring domestically and will roll out globally in 2026. Following the news of the “NikeSkims” collaboration, Nike’s stock jumped 6.2% on the day of the announcement, adding $6.7 billion in market capitalization for the company. This marks the first time in Nike’s history where the brand is working with an outside partner on a new brand offering. Breaking down ESPN’s break up with the MLB In this week’s Deeper Dive, Pompliano takes a closer look at ESPN and the MLB and why they chose to end their broadcasting deal after working together for 35 years. Though the deal was set to run through 2028, ESPN will finish out its contract in 2025 and the final three years will be voided. Plus, American Chess Grandmaster and the world’s #1 chess streamer Hikaru Nakamura, stops by the show to talk about the massive growth of chess over the years and its explosion as a digital product. Yahoo Finance Sports Report with Joe Pompliano, a vodcast brought to you by Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports, looks beyond the latest sports business headlines, analyzes all the need-to-know news - the teams, trades, and billion dollar deals - so you and your portfolio will win BIG.

Companies paid a steep $8 million for a 30-second TV spot, up from $7 million in 2024. Now, sports and media watchers can return to their regularly scheduled programming. That programming is of high intrigue. For one, rights deals for Formula 1 and the UFC are on the table in 2025. The UFC alone could command a $1 billion a year deal, more than double the one it currently has with Disney-owned ESPN. Media watchers will be looking out for whether both sports end up on streaming channels amid the struggles at legacy media giants. In the meantime, the NFL can opt out of its rights deal with all media partners except for Disney after the 2028-2029 season. If they do opt out and head to a Netflix that is not hiding its appetite for live sports, it could alter the TV business forever. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi chats with longtime media executive David Levy about these tectonic shifts in the industry, especially on the sports front. Levy spent 32 years running Turner, leading its sports portfolio and even the Cartoon Network. Today, Levy is the founder and co-CEO of Horizon Sports & Experiences—which is making a bold bet on pickleball.

Tesla (TSLA) sales in France saw a 37% year-over-year drop as the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer faces headwinds fueled by CEO Elon Musk's involvement in US President Donald Trump's second administration. Conversely, Ford (F) saw US retail sales rise 19% in March, just ahead of Trump's auto tariffs taking effect. PVH (PVH), the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, gained after issuing a positive outlook. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock fell after a judge denied the company's attempt to resolve a talc lawsuit through bankruptcy.

       "      <td id=\"T_9a14b_row103_col2\" class=\"data row103 col2\" >Major bank stocks, including JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Wells Fargo (WFC), are trading at or near record highs. Hennessy Funds Portfolio Manager David Ellison joins Market Domination host Julie Hyman to explain why the financial sector is positioned to outperform in 2025. Ellison emphasizes that interest rates are the key driver benefiting the banking sector. He explains that while rates rose for several years, their recent decline has relieved pressure on factors like deposit costs and mark-to-market issues, which he notes \"obviously created the Silicon Valley [crisis] and the other ripple effects.\" \"I think the banking industry has been pretty dormant from a performance point of view since 2008,\" he tells Yahoo Finance, describing the last decade as \"brutally awful\" for the sector. However, he suggests that a combination of softening bank regulations and declining interest rates could create \"a situation where the group could finally catch a bid beyond sort of the traditional banking model.\" To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination&nbsp;here.

Tesla (TSLA) sales in France saw a 37% year-over-year drop as the electric vehicle (EV) pioneer faces headwinds fueled by CEO Elon Musk's involvement in US President Donald Trump's second administration. Conversely, Ford (F) saw US retail sales rise 19% in March, just ahead of Trump's auto tariffs taking effect. PVH (PVH), the parent company of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, gained after issuing a positive outlook. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock fell after a judge denied the company's attempt to resolve a talc lawsuit through bankruptcy.

While the home improvement retailer issued a cautious full-year outlook for 2025, it saw same-store sales grow by 0.8% and store foot traffic surge by 7.6% in the quarter. \"It's pretty clear, I think, from the call and from what we know about retailers in general, that companies want to sort of set a lower bar. That doesn't mean they're sandbagging it. January was a softer month than December, so they did see a little bit of a slowdown that plays into the guidance,\" D.A. Davidson managing director and senior research analyst Michael Baker tells the Catalysts team. Reacting to Home Depot CFO Richard McPhail's comments on interest rates, Baker explains to Seana Smith and Madison Mills that higher rates are \"a pressure point that's not getting any worse.\" The analyst also discusses what President Trump's tariffs could mean for Home Depot's business.
